# Socket-Programming-Basics-using-Java
This implements some basic programs of Socket Programming
 
# Assignment 1
Write a multithreaded crawler program(server) that can parse certain text information with respect to different clients and find out the total number of hyperlinks within the text and finally remove them, remove any numbers, remove any punctuation symbols and send back cleaned text to the corresponding client.


# Assignment 2
Implement a basic electronic chat room application that employs a multithreaded server. Both server and client(blocking) need to be implemented. The description of server and client is as follows: 

 * a) The multithreaded chat server must broadcast each message to all connected clients. 
 * b) It should also maintain a dynamic list of socket references associated with those clients. 
 * c) The client must be implemented as a GUI that can send and receive messages until it sends a string “***bye***” (not case sensitive) 

# Assignment 3
Implement a basic Java application that employs a multithreaded server. Both server and client need to be implemented. The description of server and client is as follows: 
 * a) Each client use a text editor or word processor, create a text file containing Name, marks of four subjects and send it to the server. 
 * b) When all records have been written by different clients, server creates a file named “record.dat”, calculate percentage of marks for each client separately and store all records alphabetically (each record on separate line) by name in that file. 

# Assignment 4
Write a Java based program consisting of both server and clients, where each client can send any mathematics expression to the server where server evaluates each one using DIjkstra’s two stack algorithm and send back the result to each client. 

# Assignment 5
Using RMI in Java design a remote server that can provide several services as follows: 
 * a) Method 1: can authenticate an user (client) by a password matching mechanism. If the password is matched then a client can call a method named Selection_sort(). 
 * b) Method 2: can call a method Recursive_BInarySearch(). Also you need to design the corresponding client. 

# Assignment 6
Implement a peer to peer chat room application that employs multithreaded peers. Here every peer should be non-blocking process need to be implemented

# Assignment 7
Using RMI in Java design a remote server that can provide several services as follows: 
 * a) Method 1: select_old(), can select all odd length words and sends back to client. 
 * b) Method 2: check_palindrome, can check a word is odd length palindrome or not. 

# Assignment 8
Using RMI in Java design a remote server that can provide several services as follows: 
 * a) Server maintains a list of bank account numbers. Also provide two methods debit() and credit() for maintaining accounts of different clients in an efficient way. Also you have to properly design the corresponding client.
